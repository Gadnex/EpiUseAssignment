# EpiUseAssignment

Create the build with Maven.

Run the jar file with the command:
java -jar EpiUseAssignment-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Due to complications with outputting unicode characters in the Windows JVM I decided to print the output with the following legend:
- Heart = H
- Spade = S
- Diamond = D
- club = C
Please refer to the file Suit.java for more detail regarding the unicode characters.
